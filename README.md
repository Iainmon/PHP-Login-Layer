The name Nexal is a placeolder, just use a refractor and replace with your app name...

This was made to run only on mobile devices, using a WebKit interface. THis project was structured to work after the localy stored HTML and JavaScript page (WebKit, or some other in app HTML interpreter) on the device was loaded. Once this serverside page is loaded, it will verify if the user is a mobit device, and route it accordingly. I find that creating web applications, is much eisier than making local ones, especialy, if they need to be always connected to the internet.
